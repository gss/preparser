GSS preparser [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gss/preparser.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gss/preparser)
=============

This library parses a [Grid Style Sheet](http://gridstylesheets.org/) into an AST of rules grouped by rule type, which is thus prepared for further parsing within the [GSS compiler](https://github.com/gss/compiler).
